## Introduction

Spur Afrika's Mentorship Program, an integral component of our Child Sponsorship initiative, focuses on nurturing 115 sponsored children.

The program aims to develop social skills, broaden perspectives on future opportunities, and foster character and spiritual growth. This positive nurturing is done through one-to-one interactions with responsible adults, often mature Christians. This approach reflects Spur Afrika's commitment to transforming lives.

## Activities and Outputs

The Mentorship Program witnessed substantial growth and achievement, building upon the foundations laid in the previous year.

1.  **One-on-One Mentorship Meetings**

    -   65 sponsored students benefited from 78 one-on-one sessions. Some mentees met their mentors more than twice in the reporting period.

    -   Four mentors were very vibrant in the last six months. They met their mentees at least once every three weeks between July and December. 

    -   There is increased use of virtual mentorship sessions especially for mentors who are out of town. The mentees are now more accustomed to virtual mentorship sessions and have embraced the same. This has helped in improving the mentor-mentee relationship in spite of distance.\

2.  **Group Mentorship**

    -   Six small group mentorship sessions were held at the Spur Centre. These sessions accommodated 15 sponsored students each. 

    -   The group sessions were aimed at addressing academic, mental, and social concerns among students who do not have individual mentors.

    -   Spur Afrika's female staff conducted two mentorship sessions for Spur Sponsored girls with a key focus on hygiene and elf-empowerment sessions.

3.  **Career mentorship**

    -   Collaborating with corporate entities such as Deloitte and Fraiser Group, we organized two career mentorship sessions, attended by approximately 50 and 20 sponsored students, respectively.

    -   Notably, 20 sponsored students enrolled in coding classes, facilitated by OPENWYSE Learning and GONLINE, culminating in projects aimed at addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

    -   The Kibo Group conducted a career talk in Tech or STEM, engaging 20 of Spur students who had finished their Secondary Education together with those in college/University.

4.  **BORA boys' mentorship**

    -   Partnering with volunteer mentor Mr. Velic, Spur Afrika initiated the BORA (Boys on the Radar Again) mentorship program. The objective of the program is to prepare teenage boys for adolescence and empowering them to become responsible men.

    -   The program, launched in August, convened three times by December, demonstrating promising outcomes.

    -   There are 20 boys who attend the mentorship program at the Spur centre on Saturday afternoons.

5.  **2024 ex-Class 8 crossover 001 mentorship sessions**

    -   In December, a two-week crash Crossover program engaged 25 ex-class eight students in comprehensive training covering personal pitch, values, hygiene, effective communication, assertiveness, leadership, time management, community service, grooming, critical thinking, and decision-making.

    -   The students graduated in a lively ceremony at the Spur Afrika Community Centre, receiving certificates of participation. 

6.  **Counselling**

    -   Two students, *A* and *B*, participated in counselling sessions, each undergoing two sessions.

7.  **Mentor Training and Support**

    -   Mentor hangouts and team-building activities, attended by 44 individuals, including mentors, potential mentors, staff, and volunteers, fostered a sense of camaraderie.

    -   An end-of-year BBQ for mentors was hosted at the Spur Afrika Community Centre.
