## Introduction

Spur Afrika’s Mentorship Program is an offshoot of the Child Sponsorship Program. The program’s main aim is to help children (115 children) develop social skills, have a wider world view regarding future job opportunities, character, and spiritual formation. The mentorship is a one-on-one interaction between a sponsored child and a responsible adult who preferably is a mature Christian. This positive nurturing is part of Spur Afrika’s objective towards transforming lives.

## Activities and Outputs

1.  **One-on-One Mentorship Meetings**

    -   In the second half of the year, more mentorship sessions happened. 60 students (2 meetings per student) met their mentees in one-on-one meetings between June and December with most meetings happening in August.

    -   The mentorship sessions were held at the Spur centre and outdoors.

    -   Three mentors hosted their mentees in their houses for a few days for a change of environment.

2.  **Group Mentorship**

    -   Eight group mentorship meetings were held at the Spur centre (2 for high school students, 2 for primary school students, 2 girls only and 2 boys only).

3.  **Career Mentorship**

    -   One online career mentorship happened in November with Deloitte group in Australia. 

    -   Twenty-nine students had a chance to interact with different professionals asking questions concerning different career choices.

4.  **Mentors Appreciation and Support**

    -   Spur Afrika held two mentorship events that helped motivate the mentors.

        -   In August we had one hike with 32 mentors at Karura Forest and a BBQ in November with 35 mentors. 

        -   Five new people in attendance signed up for mentorship through participation in the mentors activities.

5.  **Christmas Love Box**

    -   25 Mentors participated in the Christmas love box, through donations and gift box preparations.

## Outcomes and Impacts

-   Improved strategies for dealing personal issues.

    -   Reduced family conflicts

-   Improved self-awareness among Spur students

    -   Better career judgement

-   Spiritual and leadership growth

    -   Five students who finished high school this year got more involved with Spur Afrika activities. They have also set good example to other younger students.

-   Increased performance among mentees

    -   e.g. Mitchel’s mentee, *I*, greatly improved in academics. She has become more confident in how she interacts with her peers.

    -   The children are more confident when expressing themselves and their use of language is better (*K*, *O*, *L*, *F*, *T*, *N*, *S* and many others in high school).

-   More students enrolled into university or college

    -   One student successfully graduated from University (Elvis) and one from a technical college (Emmanuel) 

-   The mentorship-mentee gap is slowly closing up; however, some mentors might take break.

## Challenges faced in the last six months

-   Only a half of mentors attended for the social gatherings (mentors hike and barbeque).

-   Starting new mentorship-mentee relationships can sometimes be difficult.

<!-- -->

-   Tight school schedules have made it hard for mentors to meet their mentees regularly even if they wanted to.

## Budget update

-   Funds used so far in the last 6 months is **Ksh. 548,320 (AUD 7,029)**.This includes cost of the worker in-charge of the program

<!-- -->

-   The funds for the Program are sufficient and all the costs are within the budget.

## Plans for 2023

-   Continue drumming up for more volunteer mentors.

-   Encourage mentors to consider mentoring more than one child.

-   Encourage mentors to continue awarding their mentee when they do something remarkable.

-   Encourage online mentorship for mentors who seem busy.

-   Make mentorship groups intentional and invite mentors to join. We can teach students practical skills which might help them in future.

-   Continue with mentors’ reward system to appreciate mentors who are doing an excellent job.

-   Encourage mentors to visit their mentees’ homes to relate well.

-   Have more outdoor and interactive events/activities for mentors.

-   Follow up on mentorship topics in the files.
