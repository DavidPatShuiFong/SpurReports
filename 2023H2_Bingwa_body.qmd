Bingwa, meaning "champion" in translation, is a dedicated initiative aimed at empowering young girls and boys as they navigate the path to adulthood. We are thrilled to announce the recent expansion of the program, with the inclusion of three new secondary schools at the beginning of the year. Our primary objective is to offer unwavering support and encouragement, nurturing a generation of self-assured individuals capable of overcoming challenges and attaining success in life. Through the promotion of equality and self-confidence, our mission is to cultivate a diverse community of champions who will contribute to shaping a more luminous and inclusive future for both themselves and their communities.

## Challenges faced in the last six months

-   Given that these schools are recent additions to our program, we've noticed that some girls may initially exhibit hesitancy in being open and expressive with Spur Afrika.

-   Tight school schedule has prompted us to make adjustments to the number of sessions in the three schools (Akademia, Shammah, and St. Juliet).

-   Several girls have voiced concerns about difficulties in maintaining body hygiene, particularly due to issues such as the lack of water supply in their homes.

    -   Poor sanitation conditions have made it challenging for the girls to uphold good menstrual hygiene.

    -   There are prevalent myths and misconceptions surrounding menstruation that need to be addressed.

-   Family issues at home are affecting some girls' well-being and performance in school.

-   A number of girls are faced with lack of school fees.

## Plans for the next six months

-   Continue to maximize available time during school holidays to meet Spur Girls and Akademia, Shammah, and St. Juliet girls twice a month for each school. 

-   Collaborate with Shammah, Akademia, Maono and St. Juliet’s teacher to devise a plan for distributing sanitary packs to the Girls, even during school holidays.

-   To create a safe space for our Spur girls as well as girls from Shammah, Akademia, and St. Juliet so that they can be able to talk to us freely about anything and everything; use more options of expression like notes.

-   Empower the participating girls with accurate information about menstruation to dispel the myths and misconceptions surrounding Menstruation and promote menstrual hygiene.
