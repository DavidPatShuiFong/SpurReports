## Introduction

Spur Afrika’s Mentorship Program is a complementing program to Elimisha Program. The program’s main objective is to help sponsored children (115 children) develop social skills, have a wider world view regarding future job opportunities, character development and spiritual formation. The mentorship is a one-on-one interaction between a sponsored child and a responsible adult who is of good moral standing. This positive nurturing is part of Spur Afrika’s vision of ‘Transforming lives and development’.

As we end the first half of 2023, our Mentorship Program has experienced significant growth and progress. Building on the foundations laid in the previous year, we are proud to share the positive developments that have taken place.

## Activities and Outputs

1.  **One-on-One Mentorship Meetings**

    -   55 sponsored children met their mentees in one-on-one meetings (107 sessions) between January and June. Most meetings happened in January (26), March (25) and May (22).

        ![](images/2023H1 Mentorship one-on-one A.jpg)

    -   The mentorship sessions were held at the Spur centre and outdoors.

    -   Two mentors hosted their mentees for sleepover, two took their mentees for safaris while several opted for lunch dates and studying together.

2.  **Group Mentorship**

    -   Seven group mentorship meetings were held at the Spur centre (2 for ex-high school students, 1 session with grade 8s, 1 girl’s only session, 1 boy’s only session, 4 mixed classes and 1 with junior high students).

    -   Both Kibera and Kisumu sponsored children had a joint online discussion on mental health and stress management in April. 

        -   This was amazing for the sponsored students to know each other and to also exchange idea on how to manage stress.

3.  **2023 ex-Class Eight crossover 101 Mentorship Sessions**

    -   In January, we had a 13-day mentorship session with our ex-class eight sponsored children. The sessions also attracted a few children outside of the Spur Afrika sponsorship program.

    -   A total number of 30 students received training in topics like personal pitch, values, hygiene, effective communications, assertiveness, leadership, time management, service and self-grooming.

    -   They then graduated and received certificates of participation during a hike at Mt. Longonot.

4.  **Career Mentorship**

    -   We had career mentorship sessions with our sponsored students who finished their high school level last year. The sessions were meant to help them make profound career choices and to also challenge them to consider mentoring their young counterparts.

5.  **Counselling**

    -   Over the six months, we had eight online counselling sessions for four sponsored children who were facing issues at home.

    -   The above sessions were conducted by our two volunteer counsellors (Mrs. Gaceri Baabu and Collins Odede).

6.  **Mentor Training and Support**

    We kicked off the year with our usual mentors’ training in January.

    The training assisted them in their communication flow, icebreakers and problem-solving skills.

    There was an improved attendance among mentors (43 out of 58 and 44 out of 69) in the two mentors’ events that happened between January and July.

    The training not only attracted the attention of committed mentors but also drew in a wave of new volunteers eager to contribute to our cause. We also had a team building activity with our volunteer mentors in June. The two events welcomed a total of 11 new mentors, bringing the current count of dedicated volunteer mentors to an inspiring total of 69.

## Outcomes and Impacts

-   The mentorship gap is slowly closing; we now have a total of 69 committed mentors. Some mentors have also agreed to mentor more than one mentee.

-   Improved student confidence

    -   Some students have improved in their confidence: *M1*, *M2*, *M3*, *M4*, *M5*, *M6*, *M7.*

-   Self-awareness among Spur students

-   Growth and hygiene

-   Improved communication. Strategies for dealing with personal issues.

    -   For example, *M8* and *M9* had a misunderstanding with their parents. The situation improved after mediation.

-   Spiritual growth

    -   We have introduced a spiritual group meeting with our sponsored students.

-   Better career judgement

-   Increased performance among mentees, improved discipline

    -   e.g. Grace’s mentee, *M10*, performed very well, joined a national school and had greatly improved behaviour.

-   Four of our sponsored students who finished their form four last year (i.e. finished high school) are well behaved, very proactive and have good standards.

    -   Two of our graduates (*M11*, *M12*) have actively started mentoring young students

## Challenges faced in the last six months

-   There is a possibility of having extra female mentors in the coming months.

-   Start-up mentorship relationships can sometimes be difficult. 

-   We are still experiencing tight school schedule which has made it hard for mentors to meet their mentees regularly even if they wanted to.

-   The current hard economic situation is affecting mentors in business, some have lost their jobs which can eventually affect their mentorship capacity.

## Budget update

-   Funds used so far in the last 6 months is **Ksh. 510,000 (AUD 5,100)**.This includes salary cost of one worker in-charge of the program.

-   The funds for the Program are sufficient and all the costs are within the budget.Projected costs of the 2nd half of the year is **Ksh. 420,000 ( AUD 4,200)**.

-   This cost will cover one outdoor activity for mentors that also serves as the End Year meeting and review of the mentorship journey for the year.

## Plans for 2023

-   Continue engaging mentors and invite them to bring in more people who are interested in mentorship (especially male mentors).

-   Encourage mentors to consider mentoring more than one child.

-   Encourage mentors to continue awarding their mentee when they do something remarkable.

-   Encourage online mentorship for mentors who seem busy.

-   Make mentorship groups intentional and invite mentors to join. We can teach students practical skills which might help them in future.

-   Continue with mentors’ reward system to appreciate mentors who are doing an excellent job.

-   Encourage mentors to visit their mentees’ homes to relate well.

-   Have more outdoor and interactive events/activities for mentors.

-   Follow up on mentorship topics in the files.

-   Encourage co-mentorship for female mentors.

-   Make use of counselling sessions.
