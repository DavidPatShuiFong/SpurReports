## Kinda Girls Program (school-age mothers)

Kinda Girls program is designed to offer a safe environment for young mothers (mostly teenagers) and empower them to reach their full potential. The name *‘Kinda Girls’* is a Luo word meaning *‘Working hard without giving up’*. The name was chosen as a reflection of what the program is meant to achieve. The program is tailored towards addressing stigma and giving hope to the young teenage mothers who become pregnant and mothers while still in school

### Activities and Outputs

26 girls applied the training sessions. Nineteen (19) participated, completed and graduated from the training sessions, receiving a Spur certificate.

The following topics were undertaken in the last six months: 

-   Listening exercises

    -   Understanding issues leading to teenage pregnancies.

    -   Hearing the needs and aspirations of adolescent girls (group and one on one sessions).

    -   Exploring challenges faced by young mothers.

-   Teaching about sexual and Reproductive Health, gender-based Violence, interpersonal Communication skills, self-esteem, priority setting and accountability.

-   Developing skills for economic development: Teaching to make Liquid soap, bleaching detergent, fabric softener, food preparation.

-   Counselling and one-on-one mentorship

#### Resources and inputs

-   Spur staff, resources (funds), training facilitators and mentors.

### Outcomes and Impact

Sixteen (16) young mothers who graduated are now using the skills they learnt and are now making soap to sell and for home use. One teenage mother went back to technical college to train to be a motor vehicle mechanic.

### Plans for the next six months

-   To start another class to reduce early pregnancies among teenage girls in the community.

-   Empower more girls on self-care

## Mentorship Programs

### School mentorship sessions

Goal: Improving school participation and attendance

#### Activity and Output

-   Two sessions were conducted in Gombe secondary School and three at Ochok Kadongo primary school.

-   About 279 Students were in attendance.

-   The topics covered throughout the school term were: importance of working hard, menstrual hygiene and self-awareness.

-   All the female students in attendance received a sanitary pack. All males received an undergarment.

#### Outcome and Impact

The program is expected to change attitudes to schooling among students. The program aims to reduce or eliminate school absenteeism among girls due to lack of sanitary towels while experiencing their menstrual cycle.

### Weekend mentorship sessions

The weekend mentorship sessions goals are for children to be more confident have higher self-esteem. By providing alternative and useful activities, the program aims to have less children engaged in weekend work activities such as breaking ballast.

#### Activity and output

We conducted ten weekend mentorship sessions

-   The main topics covered in the last six months were; self-awareness and obedience to parents and those in authority.

About 981 children participated in the last 6 months.

#### Resources and inputs

The weekend mentorship program requires:

-   staff member time, funds

-   game materials

-   snacks

#### Challenges

There is no shade or roof to protect children from direct sun and when it is raining during our activities.

## Oral hygiene

The program aims to teach school-going children the proper way to brush their teeth and to keep dental problems at bay.

### Activities and outputs

In the last six months, sponsored children received both toothpaste and toothbrushes

-   Demonstrations of how to properly brush teeth 

    -   Singing teeth-brushing songs 

-   Distribution of brushes and pastes

The program has reached out to our 20 sponsored children.

### Outcomes and impact

-   Our children now know how to brush their teeth and maintain oral hygiene ethics.

    -   Children changed from using ash & salt and are now using toothpaste and toothbrush.

```
-   No report on Dental problems received from our sponsored children.

-   Spur Afrika is known more to other students and in the larger community because of the program.

### Challenges

The program was limited to the sponsored children. Due to shortage of toothpaste we could not manage to do the oral hygiene sensitization in schools.

## Medical outreach clinic

### Activities

-   Spur Afrika Kisumu helps to provide preventive health care to Hollo community members through medical camps at least twice a year.

-   In partnership with Coptic hospital we were able to reach out to community members with free medical services.

#### Resources and inputs

-   Spur staff

-   9 Coptic hospital staff

-   Medicines

### Outputs

-   Twelve caregivers of the sponsored children were checked by the Doctors.

-   We were able to reach out to 105 community members with free services for minor ailments.

### Outcome and impact

-   More Community members are more aware of their health and are seeking proper medical care.

-   There is health improvement among the community and our children

    -   Several community members have given us their feedback how their health has improved since we started the free medical check-up

### Challenges

Our partners are still struggling to keep time and this affects the operations of the day.

## Finances

-   The special programs expenditure totalled Ksh. 250,000 (AUD 3,200).

-   The financial allocation was enough to cover the costs of the program.

-   The Special programs budget for the next 6 months (2023) is expected to increase (Ksh. 320,000. AUD 4,100) to cover the costs of holding a teenage mothers skill development training.
