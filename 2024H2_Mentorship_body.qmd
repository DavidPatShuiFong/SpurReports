## Introduction

Spur Afrika's Mentorship Program, a key part of our Child Sponsorship (Elimisha) program, is dedicated to supporting 150 sponsored children. Holistic development is promoted through one-on-one mentorship, group sessions with responsible adults, career guidance and peer mentorship led by responsible, committed adults. The structured interventions aim to strength social and emotional skills, broaden perpsectives of future opportunities, and encourage character and spiritual growth.

By collaborating with passionate, like-minded individuals, we strive
to create a supportive environment where every child has the
opportunity to thrive and realize their full potential.

Through tracking the impact of these engagements, we ensure the
program remains responsive, effective, and aligned with our mission
to transform lives, one child at a time.

## Activities and Outputs

The Mentorship Program has seen significant growth and success in the second half of the year. We are proud to announce the following activities throughout the first half of the year:

-   **One-on-One Mentorship Meetings**

    -   61 sponsored children met their mentors at least twice between July and December. An average of ten mentorship sessions were conducted per month. August and December, when schools are closed, had the highest number of mentorship sessions.\
        \
        There were ten (10) mentorship sessions that happened outside of the Spur Centre. The mentors either visited their mentees at home or went out for a meal or a recreational activity. This has helped in strengthening the mentor-mentee relationship.

    -   There has been a notable **increase in virtual mentorship**, particularly among mentors who are out of town or have demanding life and work schedules. Mentees have also grown more comfortable with virtual sessions, fully embracing this approach.

-   **Group Mentorship**

    Group mentorship sessions have enabled us to connect with children who currently do not have individual mentors. We are proud to share that between July and December, six group sessions were held. The sessions were led by Spur Team members with the help of Elimisha students who are currently in University or College.\
    \
    Key activities:

    -   Held group mentorship sessions at the Spur Centre with all the sponsored children from Kibera. These sessions were facilitated by the Spur Afrika workers and other peer mentors.

    -   During the group sessions, the children had the opportunity to engage with one another, discussing topics such as academics, mental health, experiences in and out of school and interpersonal relationships. These interactive sessions helped in giving opportunities for the mentees to learn from each other and build confidence in public speaking.

    -   Spur Afrika's parents and mentors came together for a joint mental health wellness session, creating a safe space to discuss mental well-being and self-empowerment. The session provided valuable insights on managing stress, fostering resilience, and supporting both themselves and the children they mentor.

-   **Career mentorship**

    -   Spur Afrika conducted five career mentorship sessions with 15 students in Secondary School. This was done in collaboration with a mentor who has expertise in career coaching and Endless Frontiers Organization.

    -   Spur Afrika held a career mentorship session with Deloitte Australia, which was attended by 30 of our children and 5 Deloitte Staff members.

-   **Extra-curricular development**

    -   15 sponsored students enrolled in coding classes facilitated by Spur Afrika in partnership with Coding with Kids Organisation. These sessions focused on enhancing their typing skills, game development, and creating projects aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The children also had the opportunity to participate in their first-ever Artificial Intelligence (AI) competition.
    -   Chess helps in enhancing cognitive development and creativity. In partnership with Passion Driven Chess Club, children participated in a total of two competitions.
    -   Engaging the children in sports activities has been beneficial to most of the participants. Students who had been weak academically have shown improvements in their studies. There has been notable improvement in their discipline as well as confidence level.

-   **Mentors training and team building\
    \
    **Mentors training is one of the key ways to support the mentors as they journey with their mentees in transforming lives. For example, mentors can be trained to challenge limiting beliefs or negative self-talk.

    -   Spur Afrika organized a training session for forty volunteer mentors and six potential mentors. The training session equipped mentors with essential skills to enhance their mentorship experience. The training covered various topics, including effective communication strategies to improve engagement with mentees, the use of icebreakers to foster connections, and problem-solving techniques for navigating challenges in mentorship. Additionally, we delved into mental health awareness, emphasizing self-care and resilience, and explored the best ways to ensure our mentors continue to feel supported and empowered. The session was an opportunity for mentors to reflect, recharge, and refine their approach to guiding and inspiring the young people they work with.

    -   There was improved attendance of mentors in the training between June and December compared to January 2024.

    -   There is strengthened communication between mentors and the Spur Afrika team.

## Outcomes and Impacts

1.  **Build Mentor-Mentee relationships**

    There has been a steady and encouraging growth in the depth and intentionality of relationships between mentors and mentees. Spur Afrika has increased
    its pool of dedicated mentors from 65 (as of January–June 2024) to 70, with some mentors taking on the responsibility of guiding more than one child. We have observed a significant rise in both home and school visits by the mentors , indicating deeper personal investment in the lives of the children. Mentors are increasingly building relationships that extend outside of Spur Afrika’s programs,
    including meeting mentees in more informal, external environments. Contributing to the children’s exposure and social development helps increase mentee confidence and self-expression.\

2.  **Educational and Academic achievement**

    Through mentorship, Spur Afrika has witnessed improvements in both
    academic performance and student engagement in co-curricular activities.

3.  **Career Advancement**

    The program has made meaningful progress in career development by partnering with organizations, including in the technology and mental health space, to expose sponsored children to diverse career opportunities. With a more defined sense of direction and purpose in career path, more students are enrolling in universities and colleges.

4.  **Proactiveness\
    **There has been a rise in student involvement in Spur Afrika programs. Learners actively participate in Spur Afrika programs during school breaks. University students and other students sponsored by Spur have not only participated actively in Spur programs but have shown a strong interest in giving back, by engaging in Spur acttivities and mentoring younger children in the Sponsorship program.

5.  **Motivation and Holistic support for Mentees**

    Mentors have continued to offer meaningful support and encouragement to their
    mentees, creating a positive impact on their academic and personal growth. This includes thoughtful gestures such as celebrating birthdays, providing exam stationery, and even covering costs for school trips all of which serve as motivation and a confidence boost for the children. Beyond one-on-one engagement to their assigned mentees, mentors are increasingly involved in group mentorship and career development sessions, showing a growing commitment to the holistic development of all children in the program.\

## Challenges faced in the last six months

1.  **Need for more mentors**\
    \
    Spur Afrika currently has a higher number of female mentors. There is a need for intentional recruitment of male mentors to create a more balanced and diverse mentorship team. A well-rounded group of mentors is essential for effectively meeting the varied needs of our children.

2.  **Increasing engagement opportunities\
    \
    **As more children transition to high school, mentorship interactions are
    limited to school holidays. This poses a challenge to consistency and
    relationship building. To maintain strong connections and mentor
    commitment, there is a growing need to introduce more flexible and
    meaningful activities that can be carried out during school terms,
    ensuring ongoing engagement despite scheduling limitations.

3.  **Initial Challenges in Establishing Mentorship Relationships**

    Some mentors, especially the new ones, still have a challenge is establishing a
    relationship with their mentees. A key contributor in this, is the
    introverted nature of most of the children that may have been fueled
    by cultural influences. Some children have been taught that it is
    not appropriate to talk too much with adults.

4.  **Time Constraints**

    Time constraints remain a persistent issue, as mentors strive to balance
    professional responsibilities, personal commitments, and consistent
    engagement in their mentorship roles.

5.  **Impact of Economic Hardship:**

    The prevailing challenging economic conditions have resulted in job losses for some mentors and struggling business for others. This potentially affects their ability to provide effective mentorship.\
    \
    A few mentors are also dealing with personal challenges, making it difficult for them to strike a balance and maintain strong mentor-mentee relationships. This economic and emotional strain may result in reduced mentorship engagement and diminished overall mentorship effectiveness.

6.  **Lack of Engagement from Some Children in the Mentorship Program\
    \
    **Despite efforts to create a supportive and inclusive environment, a small number of children have shown limited engagement in mentorship activities. Their inconsistent attendance and lack of responsiveness may be due to several possible fators such as personal challenges at home, low motiviation or difficulty connecting with mentors (especially where consistency is lacking). \
    \
    The challenge highlights the need for more personalized approaches and better strategies to address the individual needs of these children.

## Budget update

-   Funds used so far in the last 6 months is **Ksh. 420,000 (AUD 4,940)**. This includes cost of the worker in-charge of the program.
-   The budget allocated to the program was sufficient to cover all the cost of activities.

## Plans for 2025

1.  **Enhancing Mentorship Diversity and Impact**

    Spur Afrika is committed to diversifying the mentorship program by
    recruiting additional male mentors, ensuring that all mentees, particularly boys, receive one-on-one mentorship. To broaden the program’s impact, current mentors will be encouraged to mentor multiple children, expanding their positive influence.

2.  **Optimizing Mentorship through flexibility and collaborative support**

    To accommodate mentors with busy schedules, Spur Afrika will promote
    online mentorship sessions using digital platforms and timely reminders. This offers greater flexibility for both mentors and mentees. Regular follow-ups will be implemented to maintain consistent engagement between mentors and mentees. For mentors who have personal relationships with their mentees, Spur Afrika will encourage co-mentorship, fostering a collaborative environment that enhances accountability, broadens the mentorship experience and strengthen the support network.

3.  **Organise interactive events and Networking opportunities**

    Spur Afrika aims to organize more outdoor and interactive events designed to
    deepen the bond between mentors and mentees. These activities will
    provide opportunities for meaningful interactions, allowing both
    groups to engage in fun and collaborative experiences outside the
    usual mentorship framework.\
    \
    We plan to host networking sessions that will allow mentors to connect with one another, share insights, and build a stronger support community. Occasionally including mentees in these networking events and sessions will not only enhance mentor relationships but also offer valuable exposure and learning experiences for the children.
    \

4.  **Maximizing mentor skills for Mentee support**

    Spur Afrika will emphasize the value of utilizing mentors' diverse skills. Particularly in providing counseling sessions to address mentees' personal challenges. These sessions will play a crucial role in supporting the emotional, psychological and social well-being of the children. By tapping into the unique abilities and expertise that mentors bring, we aim to provide a more holistic form of support. This approach will help mentees navigate personal struggles and also strengthen their sense of security and self-worth and reinforce the role of mentors as trusted figures who care about their overall development and well-being.
